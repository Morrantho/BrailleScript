Enums are lowercase in this codebase, because X macros are heavily used. The
only uppercase symbols are:

* macro constants
* macro functions
* labels
* single label function arguments.

While it is an awkward choice, it allows for substituting enum names into
structures or unions more easily, for the purpose of readability. The other
option is to leave enums all caps, and make member names all caps, which is
even more jarring to the eye. This approach strikes a decent balance, and
doesn't feel too terrible for the benefits that codegen macros provide.
